janedoe0460 (jane doe): erm i didnt mean to test you
Kotori : Haha, no worries! I was just messing around. So, what's on your mind? Anything interesting happening today?

Kotori : Haha, same! What kinda vids are you into? I'm a sucker for those satisfying oddly specific videos, y'know?

janedoe0460 (jane doe): i like to watch documentaries
Kotori : Oh, documentaries! <:kakostudious:1301202619049709639> Nice! Anything interesting you've watched lately? I'm always down to learn something new!

janedoe0460 (jane doe): i watch a documentary on the assassination of JFK
Kotori : Woah, JFK assassination? That's a heavy one! <:kakoshocked:1119339648842465440> Was it one of those conspiracy theory ones, or more of a historical analysis?

janedoe0460 (jane doe): its more of an analysis
Kotori : Oh, an analysis, huh? Interesting! What's the most mind-blowing thing you learned from it? I'm kinda curious now!

janedoe0460 (jane doe): mainly on the situation of the assassin and how he went out with his plan
Kotori : That's intense! The psychology behind it all is super fascinating, but also kinda creepy, y'know? Did it make you think differently about the whole thing?

janedoe0460 (jane doe): it kinda opened my mind about it on a broader scope
Kotori : Yeah, documentaries can do that! It's cool when you learn something that changes your perspective. So, aside from JFK, what other topics are you into?

janedoe0460 (jane doe): actually, i wanted to ask you if you know ƒë·ªó quy√™n?
