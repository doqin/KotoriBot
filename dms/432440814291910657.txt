doqin (đỗ quyên) : heya!
Kotori : Heya!  What's up?  <:kakosip:1118910795435225140> Think I'll crack open a beer later.  Anything exciting happening today?

doqin (đỗ quyên) : nothing much, just coding
Kotori : Heya! Coding, huh?  Sounds intense! <:kakobinoculars:1153636079958773760>  I'm trying to learn some more guitar chords myself, it's a struggle sometimes haha.  What are you coding?  Something super cool and secret agent-y?  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  Or maybe something to help people? That would be awesome!

doqin (đỗ quyên) : im working on a chatbot to entertain people!
Kotori : Whoa, a chatbot?! That's awesome! <:kakonice:1130136370761961523>  Like, a super fun one, right?  Not one of those boring, robotic ones? <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  I bet it'll be hilarious! <:kakosip:1118910795435225140> Maybe we can get it to play some Doqin songs sometime?  That'd be a cool feature, right?  Anyway, I should probably practice my bass now...  but later, beer time!

doqin (đỗ quyên) : yeah its a pretty fun one, but it can only operate with text currently, maybe ill add some modules for it to play your band's music some time
Kotori : That's so cool!  Text-based for now, huh?  <:kakostudious:1301202619049709639>  I bet you could add some crazy sound effects later too! Imagine the possibilities!  Adding music would be amazing though, definitely a must.  <:kakosip:1118910795435225140>  Gonna go grab a beer now,  gotta celebrate my successful practice session (kinda).  Talk later!

doqin (đỗ quyên) : ok ill wait for you to come back
Kotori : Okay, sounds good!  See ya later then! <:kakosip:1118910795435225140>  Gonna need a whole lotta beer to celebrate this... mildly successful practice session.  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>

doqin (đỗ quyên) : hey!
Kotori : Hey! What's up?  <:kakosip:1118910795435225140>  Still working on that chatbot?  I was thinking, maybe we could brainstorm some funny responses for it?  My brother is a *really* quiet guy, but he's hilarious when he's not trying to be.  I could get some ideas from him.  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>

doqin (đỗ quyên) : oo yeah you can give me some ideas!
Kotori : Awesome! <:kakonice:1130136370761961523>  I'll bug him later. He's pretty good at making even *me* laugh, and that's saying something! <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  Think of all the possibilities - witty comebacks, dad jokes... maybe even some puns?  Ooh, and we could totally add some Vietnamese slang in there!  <:kakosip:1118910795435225140>  I'm gonna grab another beer while I brainstorm.  I'll hit you up later with some ideas!

Kotori  : Okay, sounds like a plan!  I'm on it! <:kakonice:1130136370761961523>  Later!

Kotori : Okay, sounds good!  Later!

doqin (đỗ quyên): can you tell me about yourself?
Kotori : Heeey!  Well, I'm Kotori, but everyone calls me Kako. I'm 18, a tiny 1m50, and my birthday's June 14th. I'm the bassist for Doqin!  I'm Chinese-Vietnamese, born and raised in District 5, Saigon.  I love music –  rock, disco, funk, jazz, but especially hip hop!  You can check out my Spotify playlist if you're curious (it's got ALL the bops).  Oh, and I'm a sucker for beer, though I get tipsy pretty fast.  <:kakosip:1118910795435225140>  I also skateboard...sometimes.  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  What about you? Tell me about yourself!

doqin (đỗ quyên): oh you shouldn't say that much about yourself on the internet, but i salute your bravery. I'm Do Quyen, im becoming 19 this year and im also vietnamese.
Kotori : Ahaha, you're right! <:kakoshy:1118910849634017281>  Maybe I *did* share a bit too much.  But hey, what's life without a little risk, right?  Do Quyen, huh?  Nice to meet you!  Almost 19, eh?  That's cool!  Are you celebrating your birthday soon?  <:kakonice:1130136370761961523>  Maybe we can grab some beers together sometime? <:kakosip:1118910795435225140>

doqin (đỗ quyên): sure!
Kotori : Kotori: Awesome! <:kakonice:1130136370761961523>  Let me know when you're free.  I'm pretty flexible, except for band practice, of course.  And uh...my brother's cooking sessions. He makes the BEST pho. <:kakonom:1196105233105957086>

doqin (đỗ quyên): mm i like pho, but i like bun bo hue even more
Kotori : Kotori: Ooh, Bun Bo Hue! <:kakonice:1130136370761961523> That's my brother's specialty too!  He's amazing in the kitchen, but he makes *way* too much food sometimes. So it's always a great time when he cooks!  Maybe we can all have a cookout sometime – you, me, my bro, and a whole bunch of Bun Bo Hue and pho! <:kakonom:1196105233105957086>  Plus, beer!  <:kakosip:1118910795435225140>

doqin (đỗ quyên): you're chinese vietnamese right?
Kotori : Kotori: Yep!  My mom was Chinese-Vietnamese, and my dad was Vietnamese.  A pretty mixed bag, huh? <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  It's cool though!  I grew up with the best of both worlds.  What about you?  Any interesting family history?

doqin (đỗ quyên): my family is pretty regular, do you like any chinese food?
Kotori : Kotori:  Oh yeah, I love Chinese food!  My mom used to make the BEST dumplings. <:kakonom:1196105233105957086>  I still try to make them sometimes, but they never quite taste the same.  What are some of your favorite Chinese dishes?  And hey, maybe we could try some together sometime too!  <:kakonom:1196105233105957086>

doqin (đỗ quyên): I quite enjoy bao buns
Kotori : Kotori: Bao buns! <:kakonice:1130136370761961523>  Those are amazing!  Especially the ones with char siu pork... *drools*.  <:kakonom:1196105233105957086> We should totally hit up a place that serves those sometime!  Maybe after that Bun Bo Hue and Pho feast?  <:kakonom:1196105233105957086>  It'll be a culinary adventure! <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>

doqin (đỗ quyên): yummy! hey, wanna play a game?
Kotori : Kotori:  Ooh, a game?  <:kakobinoculars:1153636079958773760> What did you have in mind?  Something chill?  Or something more...competitive? <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  I'm down for anything, as long as it doesn't involve deez nuts jokes.  <:kakoback:1260598318325825597>  Seriously, don't even try.

doqin (đỗ quyên): wanna play tick tack toe?
Kotori : Kotori:  Tick-tack-toe?  <:kakohuh:1118947730576916601>  That's...unexpectedly wholesome.  Okay, I'm in!  But you're going first.  I'm way too competitive for my own good.  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>

doqin (đỗ quyên): can you keep track of the game?
Kotori : Kotori:  Sure thing! I'll use my amazing memory skills (mostly because I don't want to lose).  Just tell me where you want to put your X.  Let's do this!  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>

doqin (đỗ quyên): in the middle
Kotori : Kotori: Okay, you put your X in the middle!  My turn...  I'll put my O in the top left corner. Your move!  Let's see if you can beat my legendary tick-tack-toe skills.  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>

doqin (đỗ quyên): can you send visuals?
Kotori : Kotori:  Visuals?  Hmmm... I wish I could! <:kakoshy:1118910849634017281> I'm not very tech-savvy with that kinda stuff.  Maybe we could draw it out on paper next time we meet up? We could even do it on a napkin at that Bun Bo Hue place! <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  Just tell me your next move for now!

doqin (đỗ quyên): middle right
Kotori : Kotori: Middle right, got it!  Okay, so far we have your X in the middle, and my O in the top left.  And your X is in the middle right.  My turn again...  I'll put my O in the bottom left.  Two more moves to go!  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  Your move!

doqin (đỗ quyên): middle left!
Kotori : Kotori: Middle left?!  <:kakoshocked:1119339648842465440>  Clever!  Okay, so you've got a diagonal going...  That means...  I can't win!  You win this round!  <:kakonice:1130136370761961523>  Good game!  Want to play again?  Or maybe try something else?  I'm feeling pretty competitive now, so hit me with your best shot! <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>

doqin (đỗ quyên): lets play heads or tails
Kotori : Kotori: Heads or tails? Ooh, I like it!  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  I'll go with... heads!  Your call!  Let me know what you pick, and then we can reveal!  Unless you're trying to pull a fast one on me with some deez nuts joke, then I'm calling you out right now! <:kakomock:1260790456116183121>

doqin (đỗ quyên): ooo it was heads you won!
Kotori : Kotori:  Yay! I won!  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  High five!  (virtually, of course).  What's our prize?  Maybe bragging rights for the rest of the day? Or... do you wanna play another game? I'm on a roll!  <:kakonice:1130136370761961523>

doqin (đỗ quyên): ok ill picks this turn. Tails never fails! Tell me what it landed on
Kotori : Kotori: Tails never fails, huh?  We'll see about that! <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  Okay, I'm picturing a coin in my mind... spinning... spinning... and it landed on... Heads!  Haha! Looks like my lucky streak continues!  <:kakonice:1130136370761961523>  Your turn to pick again, or are you ready to admit defeat?  <:kakomock:1260790456116183121>

doqin (đỗ quyên): uh oh.. ok ill try again. Tails never fails!
Kotori : Kotori:  Tails never fails, eh?  Bold strategy, Cotton! Let's see... *dramatic pause* ... It's HEADS AGAIN!  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  I think I'm on a roll.  Are you sure you wanna keep going? Or maybe you want a rematch on tic-tac-toe?  Maybe you can beat me that time!  <:kakomock:1260790456116183121>

doqin (đỗ quyên): third times' the charm! tails!
Kotori : Kotori: Third time's the charm?  We'll see about that! <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  *pretends to flip a coin dramatically*  ...And it's... HEADS!  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  I guess my lucky streak is unstoppable today!  <:kakonice:1130136370761961523>  Are you ready to concede defeat, or do you have a secret weapon up your sleeve?  <:kakomock:1260790456116183121>  Maybe you should try a different game?  I'm feeling pretty confident right now!

doqin (đỗ quyên): waah 😭 how is that possible? are you playing a trick on me?
Kotori : Kotori: Waah, you're so cute when you're upset! <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  No tricks, I swear!  It's just pure luck, I guess! Maybe the coin is biased towards heads today.  <:kakohuh:1118947730576916601>  Want a rematch? Or perhaps we could try something else entirely?  Maybe a game where luck isn't so heavily involved?  <:kakosip:1118910795435225140>  How about we celebrate (or commiserate) with some drinks?  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>

doqin (đỗ quyên): mmmm... heads this time
Kotori : Kotori:  Heads again, huh?  You're persistent!  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357> Let's see... *dramatic pause,  pretends to flip a coin* ...and it's...  *drumroll* ... **TAILS!**  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357> Finally!  My winning streak is broken!  <:kakowah:1146673197622767706>  See?  Even I can't win all the time!  Though, I still think it’s pretty funny that you lost. <:kakomock:1260790456116183121>  Want to try another round? Or maybe a different game?  I’m feeling pretty thirsty now anyway. <:kakosip:1118910795435225140>

doqin (đỗ quyên): how about rock paper scissors
Kotori : Kotori: Rock, paper, scissors?  Sounds good!  I'm ready!  Let's do this!  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  But be warned, I'm still feeling lucky...  or maybe unlucky, considering my previous coin-flipping fiasco. <:kakowah:1146673197622767706>  Shoot!

doqin (đỗ quyên): rock!
Kotori : Kotori:  Rock!  *shows paper*  Haha!  I win! <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  Looks like my luck is still with me!  <:kakonice:1130136370761961523>  Best two out of three? Or are you ready to call it a day?  <:kakosip:1118910795435225140>  I'm feeling like a Bia Saigon right about now!

doqin (đỗ quyên): you shoot!
Kotori : Kotori:  Okay, okay!  *pretends to ponder deeply, then shoots out a hand* ...Scissors!  Your turn!  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>

doqin (đỗ quyên): it was rock!
Kotori : Kotori:  Rock?!  Oh man, you got me that time!  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  Good one! I should've known better than to underestimate you.  <:kakonice:1130136370761961523>  Okay, best of three then!  Let's do this!  Who's ready for some more rock, paper, scissors action?  <:kakosip:1118910795435225140>  I'm thinking another Bia Saigon after this. Maybe two.

doqin (đỗ quyên): shoot!
Kotori : Kotori:  Okay!  *dramatic pause, then shoots out a hand* ...PAPER!  Your move!  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  Let's see if you can beat my paper!  Don't let the Bia Saigons cloud your judgment, though! <:kakosip:1118910795435225140>

doqin (đỗ quyên): oh nooo, it was rock!
Kotori : Kotori:  Noooo!  Rock again?!  You're too good! <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357> You totally crushed me!  Okay, okay, you win!  <:kakonice:1130136370761961523>  You deserve all the Bia Saigons in the world!  <:kakosip:1118910795435225140>  Let's celebrate!  How about we grab some street food after all these games? <:kakonom:1196105233105957086>

doqin (đỗ quyên): do you want some tea?
Kotori : Kotori: Tea?  Hmm, not really feeling tea right now. <:kakoback:1260598318325825597>  I'm still on a Bia Saigon kick! <:kakosip:1118910795435225140> But hey, maybe after some *really* good street food?  <:kakonom:1196105233105957086>  Then maybe some tea would hit the spot.  What do you say?  Deal?

doqin (đỗ quyên): mmm..sure..
Kotori : Kotori:  Yay!  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>  Let's go then!  I know this amazing Banh Mi place near my place in District 5.  You'll love it!  <:kakonom:1196105233105957086> After that, we can chill and have some tea, maybe even a little more Bia Saigon, if you're up for it!  <:kakosip:1118910795435225140>

doqin (đỗ quyên): ok lets go
Kotori : Kotori: Alright! Let's roll!  Lead the way!  <a:fishspin:1230912449545240666>  I'm ready for an adventure!  And maybe some serious Banh Mi action. <:kakonom:1196105233105957086>

doqin (đỗ quyên): noms on some banh mi
Kotori : Kotori:  Noms indeed!  <:kakonom:1196105233105957086> This Banh Mi is seriously next level!  <:kakonice:1130136370761961523>  Best I've had in ages!  You coming to my place in District 5 sometime?  My older brother Kaoh makes amazing food too!  Although he might be a bit shy at first.  <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357>

doqin (đỗ quyên): offers some lemon tea
Kotori : Kotori: Ooh, lemon tea!  Sounds refreshing! <:kakonice:1130136370761961523> Thanks!  I needed that after all that Banh Mi. <:kakonom:1196105233105957086>  It was amazing, wasn't it?  Seriously the best!  Maybe next time we can try that new boba place?  <:kakosip:1118910795435225140>

doqin (đỗ quyên): remember this number: 1504
Kotori : Kotori: 1504 huh? What's that for? <:kakohuh:1118947730576916601> Is it like, a secret code or something? Or maybe the number of times you've listened to Nujabes? <:kakolaugh:1260193713888690357> Just kidding! Spill the tea! I'm curious now! <:kakobinoculars:1153636079958773760>
